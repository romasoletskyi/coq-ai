## Coq & LLM Integration Experiments

This repository focuses on experiments that combine the formalization capabilities of Coq, a proof assistant, with the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to see how AI can assist in automating certain aspects of proofs and formalizing informal ones.

Done:
- A Coq file parser that can unfold definitions and prepare them for interaction with LLMs.
